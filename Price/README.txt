Hi!

How to execute, step by step:

1- execute the class PriceApplication.java to start the service.
2- go to http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html to use the OpenAPI.
    OR u can execute the urls that appears there.
3- All the test that the exam demands are on the same Test class called PriceTest_1_2_3_4_5. U could found it in SRC/TEST
    dir.
    To execute it, we need the server up, if not, will give errors.
4- if u want to check the DataBase, go to http://localhost:8080/h2-console. Just need to specify the url:
        jdbc:h2:mem:inditex

As last, hope u could apollogies me becasue some test are not implemented due to a repetitive validations. Also, I let
some code commented, yes this not cmply with good practices but I let it there to demostrate that I have more knowledge
that I could implements in other cases.

Finishing, It's clear that this applicaiton could be improved in some points, I apreciate if u give me ur feedback.

Thanks you.
